* Wed May 12 1999 Ryan Weaver <ryanw@infohwy.com>
  [gcombust-0.1.12-1]
- Version 0.1.12 May 12 1999
- now adds '' around audio files too (broke on filenames with spaces etc. before)
  note that the command generating is still buggy by design, it will brake on
  filenames containing ' and other special characters
- suport for fs= option (and CDR_FIFOSIZE)

* Mon Mar 29 1999 Ryan Weaver <ryanw@infohwy.com>
  [gcombust-0.1.11-1]
- Version 0.1.11 Mar 29 1999
- BUGFIXES:
- cd-rw info progressbar should print some more info now :)
  (untested, please send me some output from a cdrecord blank=...
  session if I didn't get it right this time either)
- NEWS:
- support for making bootable cds - it's maybe a bit clumsy though
- now requires gtk 1.2.x
- now requires cdlabelgen 1.1.3 (WYSIWYG attempt dumped in favor for
  more intelligent cdlabelgen :)
- small code reorganization and it doesn't build with gcc -g as default
  anymore (still a good idea to strip it though)
- load/save image/audio selections (audio selections only works with
  pure audio cd selections)

* Mon Mar 22 1999 Ryan Weaver <ryanw@infohwy.com>
  [gcombust-0.1.10-1]
- Version 0.1.10 Mar 19 1999
- BUGFIXES:
- now compiles with gtk 1.2.0 again, if you have gtk 1.2.0
  change the GCOM_GTK_VER in src/globals.h to 12 (default is
  gtk 1.0.x, with GCOM_GTK_VER set to 10) - gtk 1.0.x support
  will be dropped soon, I'm getting sick of testing against two
  different versions for every release

- Version 0.1.9 Mar 19 1999
- BUGFIXES:
- CDR_DEVICE=1,0 works
- added lot's of error checks in contractions.c
- small g_list bug fixed (hopefully)
- quotes volume IDs
- contractions.c: iso<->cdr close-mixup in p_open_r_err_in
- NEWS:
- prints out all unprocessed output from mkisofs/cdrecord
  to textboxes, added MB burned + fifo label
- blank=... for cd-rw (untested as I don't have a cd-rw drive)
- started on the menus
- printing labels using cdlabelgen 0.70
  (http://www.red-bean.com/~bwf/software/cdlabelgen/)
  the printwindow tries to match (WYSIWYG) what cdlabelgen can handle
